      A gift shop is a store primarily selling souvenirs relating to a particular topic or theme.
       Items sold include kitchenware, toys, T-shirts, postcards and handmade collections. 
       Gift shops are often found in tourist areas, although this is not always the case.
       A personalised gift is made exclusively for a person by having their name or picture 
       engraved or imprinted on a cushion, photo frame, mug, keyring or pen. 
       It lets the recipient know that this gift is specifically made and selected for t
       hem after putting much thought and effort.
